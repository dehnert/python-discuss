== pydiscuss ==

pydiscuss is a pure-Python implementation of Project Athena forum protocol
called discuss. It aims to work well with the existing servers, although
as a clean-start implementation it may not handle several edge cases correctly.

=== Example code ===

import discuss

# Open connection to the server
cl = discuss.Client("charon.mit.edu")

# Pick our meeting
mtg = discuss.Meeting(cl, "/var/spool/discuss/vasilvv-test")

# Read the description
mtg.load_info()
print mtg.long_name

# Read all the transaction headers and print them
for trn in mtg.transactions():
    print "[%i] %s <%s (%s)>" % (trn.number, trn.subject, trn.signature, trn.author)

# Print the text of the last one
print "----- Text -----"
print mtg.get_transaction(mtg.last).get_text()
